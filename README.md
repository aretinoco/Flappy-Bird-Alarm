# Flappy-Bird-Alarm

This is the final project I completed for the Google-sponsored Computer Science Computering INnitiative (CSSI). I collaborated with another team member: 

We used the p5 javascript library to build an alarm that initiates the Flappy Bird game once it reaches the time input. The user can utilize this to stay awake and create awareness after the alarm has woken them up.

If you would like to setup and run this project, you can download the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser.
